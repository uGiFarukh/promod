In addition to license terms set by Activision for new game materials, you agree to Promod Modder Ethical Public License 1.0 (PModEPL) based on Modder Ethical Public License 1.0 (ModEPL by OpenWarfare Project) and the Simple Public License:

The PModEPL applies to the mod assets required to produce a fully working copy of the mod but do not ship with the original game or its mod tools, including, but not limited to source code, menus, images, models.
You agree to the PModEPL by copying, distributing, hosting or making a derivative work of mod assets.

You get the royalty free right to:
 * Use the mod assets for any purpose;
 * Make derivative works of it or combining assets during runtime (in both cases this is called a "Derived Work");
 * Host, copy and distribute it and any Derived Work.

If you host, copy or distribute the mod assets or a Derived Work, you must give back to the community by:
 * Prominently noting the date of any changes you make;
 * Leaving other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and license terms in place;
 * Providing these mod assets (including assets that are combined with the mod during runtime, but are not part of original game assets which can be obtained by purchasing a copy of the game) in a form that is easy to get and best to modify;
 * Licensing it to everyone under PModEPL;
 * Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that license.

There are some things that you must shoulder:
 * You get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind;
 * If the mod assets damage you in any way, you may only recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not recover any other damages, including those called "consequential damages." (The state or country where you live may not allow you to limit your liability in this way, so this may not apply to you).

The PModEPL continues perpetually, except that your license rights end automatically if:
* You do not abide by the "give back to the community" terms (your licensees get to keep their rights if they abide);
* Anyone prevents you from distributing the mod assets under the terms of the PModEPL.
